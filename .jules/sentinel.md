**Vulnerability:** Weak matching logic in error suggestions can mislead users or automated agents into calling unintended tools if they make a typo that partially matches multiple tool names.

**Prevention:** Implemented a length-difference based tie-breaker for prefix matches in `findClosestMatch` to ensure the most specific match is suggested.
